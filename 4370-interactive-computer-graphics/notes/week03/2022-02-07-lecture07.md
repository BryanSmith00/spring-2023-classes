Interactive computer graphics lecture 07

Viewing in ray tracing - start with the pixel in the image and calculate the ray that projects to that point

Viewing by projection - start with a point in 3D space and compute the image pixel that it projects to

fov = 2 arctan(h / 2d)

h = hight of the viewing plane

d = distance from viewing plane to the sensor (focal length)

Scene graph represents the primitves and each of their transformations in order to render the scene

- implemented as acyclic directed graph
- paths from root to leaves are identified with scene objects
- transforms are accumulated along paths
- objects can contain properties like shape and color
