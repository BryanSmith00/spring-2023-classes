# introduction, finite automata, regular expressions

## finite automata

circles are states

arrows are transitions between states

accepting states: double circle

input: finite string (ex. 0s and 1s)

output: accept or reject

accept if it ends on an except state, reject if not

### language of a finite machine

the set of all strings that result in an accept state

machine M recognizes set A, A = L(M<sub>1</sub>)

### finite automata formal definition

a finite automaton M is a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q<sub>0</sub>, F)

Q: finite set of states

Σ: finite set of alphabet symbols

δ: transition function δ: Q cross Σ -> Q

- given a state and an alphabet the machine returns a state
- δ(q, a) = r means that a is the transition between states q and r

q<sub>0</sub>: start state

F: set of accepting states
