# automata lecture 2

alphabet - finite, non-empty, set of atomic elements (typically called letters)

A* - set of all words over the alphabet A (countably infinite set)

word - finite sequence of letters

epsilon - empty word

concatination - putting words together (uses multiply dot?)

|u| - length of word u

language - any subset L of A*

0 - empty language

{epsilon} - set containing the empty word

0 != {epsilon}

<i>set theory applies, union, intersection, complement, etc</i>
